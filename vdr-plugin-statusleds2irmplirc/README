Description:

This plugin shows the status of VDR via LED:
when VDR starts, the LED is turned on;
when VDR stops, the LED is turned off;
if VDR is recording, the LED blinks (as often as recordings are active).

The LED is controlled by a microcontroller, connected via USB (which serves also as IR-receiver for the remote, see https://github.com/j1rie/IRMP_STM32/blob/master/stm32IRstatusled/README).


Requirements:
=============

- vdr 1.2.x (1.1.x should be work also)


Installation and Compilation:
=============================

- cd $VDR/PLUGINS/src
- Extract statusleds-*.tgz
- ln -s statusleds-* statusleds
- cd $VDR
- make plugins


Running the plugin:
===================

- Append -Pstatusleds to the vdr commandline 
- Append plugin parameters, if you don't want to use the OSD

  -d timing, --duration=timing    Sets the timing values in 100ms
                                  Format: on-time,off-time,on-pause-time
				  Default: 1,10,5

  -p, --perrecordblinking         Enables record count siganlisation

  -w, --prewarn                   warn before recording

  -i, --irmlirc_device            irmlirc device (default /dev/irmp_stm32)
  not needed, if you use the udev rule 70-irmp.rules

How active recordings will be signaled:
=======================================

- If recordings are active, the led is blinking:
  - Blinking per record is disabled:
    - The led is on for on-time
    - The led is off for off-time
  - Blinking per record is enabled:
    - The led is on for on-time and off for on-pause-time. This repeats
      for each concurrent recording.
    - The led is off for off-time
- If no recording is active, the selected led is turned on

OSD:
====

- The plugin is configurable via the OSD
- There is an entry Settings->Plugins->statusleds2irmphidkbd

PROBLEMS:
=========

- The command line switch -d seems not to be functional.
- If vdr was killed with signal -9 during active recording the LED may remain on.
