See make.config.template.

"STM32F103CC" is a name I gave to the microcontroller showing up as
Device: STM32 F10xx High-density
Device ID: 0x414
Revision ID: Rev. Z
Flash Size: 256kbytes
in ST-Link Utility
and with idcode: 0x2ba01477 in openocd
In the matrix of STM32F103 devices a device with 48 pins and 256 kB flash would be a STM32F103CC.
But it does not exist in that matrix.
