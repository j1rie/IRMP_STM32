For the sticks there are several hardware designs.
Make sure the extension board fits your stick.

Stick1_jr1 is based on:

I strongly recommend the optocoupler version. It is not very likely that you actually need it, but
in case you do have a motherboard, which needs it, it will save you much debugging effort.

If you like a tiny design, take a look at https://github.com/Sl-Alex/IRMP_STM32_MINI and at

In case you want to attach a 4 digit display tm1637, connect:
GND - GND, 5V - 5V, DIO - B11, CLK - B4, see st32tm1637.h.
